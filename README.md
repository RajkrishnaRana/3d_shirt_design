# 3d_shirt_design

This is a 3d design shirt website made by using ReactJs, ThreeJs, React Framer Motion. 

# You can find the link of the website here : https://3d-shirt-design-raj.netlify.app/
Although in this website there is a section called ASK AI. I tried to implement AI design features also using OpenAI API, but found out that OpenAI API is no longer free service, so failed to implement themðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£. If anyone know how to implement OpenAI API free in a website, or some alternate way to implement the AI feature, feel free to contact me in twitter or Linkedin.
